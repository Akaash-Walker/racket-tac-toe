# Racket-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe Game written in Racket!

**Background**
In case you've never heard of it, Racket is a general purpose programming language that is is a modern dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme. It's quite an odd language, making it perfect to write a game with! The program is written using the htdp universe library, which allows for the gui of the game. The program also has an interesting Mini-max alogrothim for the opponent AI, which uses a recursive backtracking search of all possible outcomes in a binary tree to determine its next move. The AI has levels from 0-9, with 0 being random placements on the board and 9 being that it searches the entire tree for its next move.

**Runtime Instructions**
To play, download the code, run the program using DrRacket, and type "(main START)" into the terminal.
Pressing numbers 0-9 on the keyboard will select the difficulty level of the AI.

Have fun and enjoy!
